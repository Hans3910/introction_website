      <h1>Project Battleship</h1>
      <p class="battleship-info">This battleship project was the first full-stack development project i participated in. The goal was to develop a working version of the well-known game "Battleship". I completed this project in a team of 5 students during my time at PXL. The backend of the game is developped in C++ using the .Net framework. The frontend was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. To be completely honest the backend was set-up by our mentor but we still filled in more then 50% of the backend code. Mainly adding the methods necessary to register player data, create the grid, place the ships and let the players shoot.</p>
